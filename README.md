# hackathon-toolbox : Bootstrap your week-end application.

Every developers who participate to hackathons know lots of time is lost in
configuration, basic stuff like databases with users, etc.

As a hackathon fan, I share with you scripts, Makefiles, micro-services, links
and frameworks which can bootstrap your application and help you to build
something easier and faster.

## Database

- Makefile to create a PostgreSQL database, backup, restore. Just write your SQL schema.

## Micro-service.

#### Scala

- User management.
